    <h1 style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 25px; text-align: center; color: darkblue;">U.S. Title 34</h1>
    <h2 style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 25px; text-align: center; color: darkblue;">Crime Control and Law Enforcement</h2>


<p style="text-align: left;"><u><i><b>U.S. Code Title 34 Crime Control and Law Enforcement</i></u></b>, contain subtitles and chapters regarding the judicial laws of the U.S. The purpose is to house, organize and maintain the crime and law enforcement laws of the U.S. Code.  Basically, to keep all the subject matter laws in one place for easier maintenance when being revised or added. It originally pertained to the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Forces, named Navy. That changed on August 10 of 1956, when The Office of Law Revision Council of the House of Representatives revised the statutory provisions contained in Title 34, Navy. The provisions were then codified to Title 10, naming it Armed Forces. The Office of Law Revision Council of the House of Representatives are responsible for preparing and publishing the United States Code. The Impetus of Title 34 is gathering into one title the growing body of law that deals with the issues of crime control and law enforcement where it could be better managed and organized. It covers programs or activities that are in relation to law enforcement with the responsibilities being primarily those of the Department of Justice or the Attorney General. U.S. Code: Title 34 was not enacted until September 1, 2017.</p></u></i>

<p style="text-align: left; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Starting in the 1960’s, numerous new Crime Control and Law Enforcement program laws were passed, distributed to other titles. This created the need for one title to contain all the subject matter of Crime Control and Law Enforcement. Thus, on September 1, 2017, Title 34 was enacted to house such laws. One of these provisions that would later be reclassified to Title 34 was the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994. It is the largest crime law and referred to as the “Clinton Crime Bill” due to former president Bill Clinton involvement in it. These new provisions were scattered in various titles and reclassified and coded.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 25px; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><u>The title is divided into six subtitles:</u></p>
